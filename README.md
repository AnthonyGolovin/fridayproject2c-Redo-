Specs:

The first thing we will create is a prompt prompting the user to enter a sentence. The user will enter a sentence in a "Console.ReadLine()" line and shortly after the user will again be prompted to type in a word they would like to find duplicates of in their sentence.

The we will create is a space where we can store the user input i.e. Array, List, or Dictionary. (In  this case will use the array method).

After creating the array we will use a for loop to go through the entire user input and look for duplicate words.  

From there once we have collected the repeated word data, we will go through user input and return an integer of repeated words.

After we have collected the integer of the repeated word, will will return that integer to the user.

TEST: We will create a test that will test whether the function actually catches duplicate words without counting words within words.
